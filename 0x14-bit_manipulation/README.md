#BIT MANIPULATION

##Introduction

In computing, a `bit` (short for "`binary digit`") is the basic unit of information used in digital communications and computer storage. It is a `binary value` that can represent one of two possible states, typically denoted as `0` and `1`.

[Bits]() are used to represent information in various forms such as `text`, `images`, `audio`, and `video`. By `combining multiple bits`, it is possible to represent more complex data structures and values. For example, `8 bits` (also called a `byte`) can represent values between `0` and `255`, and are commonly used to represent characters in computer text encoding systems.

[Bits]() are also the building blocks of digital logic circuits, which are used to perform computations and operations in computers and other digital systems. By `combining` and `manipulating bits` using logical operations such as `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, complex calculations and operations can be performed.

##Bit Manipulation

[Bit manipulation]() refers to the process of manipulating the individual bits that make up a **binary number**, often using **bitwise operators**. [Bit manipulation]() is a fundamental technique in computer programming and is used in a variety of applications such as **data compression**, **cryptography**, and **embedded systems** programming.

With [bit manipulatio](), you can perform operations such as **setting**, **clearing**, **toggling**, and **shifting** individual `bits` within a ***binary number***. **For example**, you can use bitwise `AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, and `NOT` operators to manipulate the `bits` within a `number`. You can also `shift` the `bits` `left` or `right` to `multiply` or `divide` the `number` by powers of `2`.

[Bit manipulation]() can be used to `optimize code` for performance by `reducing` the `number` of `operations needed` to perform certain tasks. It is often used in **low-level programming**, such as **operating system** `kernels`, `device drivers`, and `embedded systems`, where efficiency is `critical`. However, [bit manipulation]() can also make **code** more **difficult** to **read** and **understand**, so it should be used **judiciously and with care**.

##PROJECT QUESTIONS

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89.

###OPTIONAL QUESTIONS

`Task 0. 0:` Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.

`Task 1. 1:` Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.

`Task 2. 10:` Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.

`Task 3. 11:` Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.

`Task 4. 100:` Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.

`Task 5. 101:` Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.


###ADVANCED QUESTIONS

`Task 6. Endianness:` Write a function that checks the endianness.

`Task 7. Crackme3:` Find the password for [this program](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x13.c).

First of you have to use `gdb crackme3` to crack password.
If you got real password **there is something required to be done**in termial such as: `echo "password" > 101-paswword` after use `cat > 101-password` then `Enter`
After Type `password` plus `^D` and again Press and hold control plus D (Ctrl + D or ^D).
after this check code by `./crackme3 `cat 101-password`` to get congratulation! if not, create 101-password by the scrip below in answer.
